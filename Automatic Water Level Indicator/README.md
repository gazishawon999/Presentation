# 🚰 Automatic Water Level Indicator using NAND Gate

This presentation is prepared as part of our **Digital Logic Design (DLD)** course.  
The project demonstrates the design and working principle of an **Automatic Water Level Indicator** implemented using **NAND logic gates**.

The system helps to indicate different water levels in a tank automatically and prevents water overflow by providing timely alerts.
